Overlapping parts were erased with white paint, and the first animation of Japan was completed through repeated shooting.<br>\n<br>\nThis work is considered to be the first recorded professional animation of Asia, it also contains the first dramatic structure in which a main character has a humorous name. <br>\n<br>\n(Source: CAPSULE Blog: Total Color List Production Committee)<br>\n<br>\n<i>There is a lot of speculation if this movie was in fact ever released. It was screened several times at a movie company, but it is said that even the author, Shimokawa, was not satisfied with the work due to the sloppy movement. There is however, no evidence that it actually released in theaters. The name of the work does not exist in the list of theater screenings in Magazine \"Kinema record\" or \"Movie Review\" for Janurary 1917. Also since there is so few materials that mention this film and no copy has ever been found, the contents of the story are completely unknown. <br><br>Some even speculate that was released at a later date in 1917 under a different name.</i><br><br>",

Since then he has had to deal with spirits called kotowari that reside in the darkness of the souls of people who are related to him, no matter how distant. Kotowari are soul fragments created from a person’s suffering and they can normally only be seen, heard and touched by that individual. Even if the kotowari is destroyed, it will keep respawning unless the cause of the suffering is resolved. Shortly after transferring to a school in a history-laden sightseeing town, Mishiro encounters a kotowari and decides to search for its owner. However, there isn’t just one kotowari as many other girls harbour their own suffering.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Visual Novel Database)",

Even though everything’s so different, there’s something about the laid-back atmosphere that makes her feel strangely comfortable. While she’ll certainly miss parts of her old life, there’s a whole lifetime of experiences waiting to be enjoyed with her new friends Renge, Komari, Natsumi, and Suguru!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

    "description": "After several years in the military, Rain Yashima has grown impatient and frustrated. The Japanese army was not going on the offensive at all, and there was an overwhelming difference in the level of weaponry between them and the enemy army, the Seventh. At this rate, it would only be a matter of time before they lost the war, let alone overturn their inferior position.<br><br>\nThen a ray of hope landed on Rain's doorstep. In her hands is the power to judge history, and in her hands is the power to weave history. The girl abandons her womanhood and vows to fight as steel. Now, Yashima Rain's lonely war begins.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Video description, Translated)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: The project began as a series of doujin shorts by the unit Thumbnail,  agreed to produce the anime. The project was announced in 2009 to be produced by the Japanese arm of the French company Ankama Games. Production halted in 2011 due to the dissolution of the production division of its sponsor Ankama Japan, to later release in 2013.<br>\nTo date, only 1 episode (\"Episode 0\") has been produced.</i>",
